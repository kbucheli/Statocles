## Fixed

* Blog slugs (folder path) are now a bit neater: Apostriphes do not turn
  into dashes, and leading and trailing dashes are removed. So, where
  the blog post "It's good!" would have previously looked like
  "/2016/06/02/it-s-good-/", it will now look like
  "/2016/06/02/its-good/". Thanks [@Ferki](http://github.com/ferki)!
